# first-cracktro
## What is it, exactly?
This is a graphical demonstration made with only Raylib as the graphics library and C/C++ as the programming language. This code is read-only, and is intended to be more of a showcase of my programming skills.

## What is a cracktro?
In short terms, cracktro is an abbreviation of "crack intros" which is a type of intros crackers used in their pirated games as a way to showcase their programming skills. My cracktro does ***NOT*** condone piracy in any way, shape or form, and is simple made because not only is it one of the simpler ways to showcase graphical capabilities, but also it is partially driven by nostalgia and admiration of late 1980s - early 1990s work.
